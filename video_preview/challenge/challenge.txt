Objectives
Practice using onmouseover and onmouseout
Practice working from an existing code base
For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code (download here: https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/1624039965__video-preview.zip) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from https://www.pexels.com/videos/.  Next we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.
Hints:
We may need to make use of the .play() and .pause() methods - reference:https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_video.asp

We may also need the video to be muted as modern browsers want users to interact with (click) videos for them to start playing.

Add a <video> into the existing project

When hovering the video it should preview the content by playing the video on mute
